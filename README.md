# Productivia

A simple to-do list webapp made in Vue.js. I'm looking to expand the project into a SPA built mobile-first!

## Demo

## Mock-up

## Upcoming features
- Convert current project to a SPA
- Cache todos and progress
- Add other staple PWA features (manifest.json)
- Transform design to look like my prototype!
